# Sales_Analytics

## **Description:**

#### The Sales Analytics database is designed to import flat file sales data and query that data. The queries identify top customers in terms of money spent and frequency of purchase as well as the most popular products. 

## **Getting Started:**

1. Execute the *OnlineShopCreateDB.sql code*
2. Execute the *OnlineShopImportData.sql code*

## **Project Requirements Included:**

* Group 1: Reading Data from a Database
	- *Write a SELECT query that uses a WHERE clause.*
	- *Write a SELECT query that utilizes an ORDER BY clause.* 

* Group 2: Updating / Deleting Data from a Database
	- *Write a DML statement that DELETEs a set of rows with a WHERE clause. The
values used in the WHERE clause should be a variable.*

* Group 3: Optimizing a Database
	- *Design a NONCLUSTERED INDEX with ONE KEY COLUMN that improves the
performance of one of the above queries.*

 
## **Future Features:**
